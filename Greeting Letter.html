                        <strong>Dear Ashu ‚ù§Ô∏è</strong>
                        <p>
                            I hope you‚Äôre doing well. Just writing this little note to remind you that everything you‚Äôre
                            dreaming of will soon be yours. One day, you‚Äôll look back and realize that the problems
                            which once made your heart heavy were just small obstacles - preparing you for the beautiful
                            things ahead.

                            Don‚Äôt forget me when you finally reach where you always wanted to be.

                            And yes, when you achieve all your dreams - remember, I‚Äôll be the one who‚Äôs even happier
                            than you. ü•±
